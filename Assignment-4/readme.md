<h1>assignment 4 technical report</h1>
Alt text is how we help describe the image to those who may be visually impaired or for those who just can't understand an image. It helps to explain.
I have came across all of the boxes to type and/or choose a selection such as a dropdown box or radio button. The dropdown box is almost always there when selecting what state one lives in. This box is important because it allows a plethora of choices without taking up space on the page. Hence the drop down aspect.
This assignment was the most challenging to date but also the most fulfilling. This stuff is fascinating and I think knowing these simple things will be big in the future especially if I ever want to create my own website.
