<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<div id="lyrics" class="container lyrics">
  <p> For all the times that you rain on my parade<br />
  And all the clubs you get in using my name<br />
  You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake<br />
  You think I'm crying, on my own well I ain't </p>

  <p> And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care<br />
  I don't but, you still hit my phone up<br />
  And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'<br />
  I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that<br />
  My mama don't like you and she likes everyone<br />
  And I never like to admit that I was wrong<br />
  And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on<br />
  And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own </p>

  <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much<br />
  Oh baby you should go and love yourself<br />
  And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'<br />
  You should go and love yourself </p>

  <p> But when you told me that you hated my friends<br />
  The only problem was with you and not them<br />
  And every time you told me my opinion was wrong<br />
  And tried to make me forget where I came from</p>

  <p>And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care<br />
  I don't but, you still hit my phone up<br />
  And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'<br />
  I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that<br />
  My mama don't like you and she likes everyone<br />
  And I never like to admit that I was wrong<br />
  And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on<br />
  And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own</p>

  <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much<br />
  Oh baby you should go and love yourself<br />
  And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'<br />
  You should go and love yourself</p>

  <p>For all the times you made me feel small<br />
    I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all<br />
  I never felt so low when I was vulnerable<br />
  Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?</p>

  <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much<br />
  Oh baby you should go and love yourself<br />
  And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'<br />
  You should go and love yourself<br />
  'Cause if you like the way you look that much<br />
  Oh baby you should go and love yourself<br />
  And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'<br />
  You should go and love yourself</p>
