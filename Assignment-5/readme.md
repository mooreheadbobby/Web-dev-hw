<h1> assignment 5 technical report </h1>
<p>Div basically is a way to make the website more readable which in turn means you don't necessarily need to style as much. The class attribute is exactly what it sounds like. It groups elements that are similar to each other using the same name value. ids is basically the way to identify on this scale. It refers to its unique identifier. A span element is much like a div element but it spans across multiple to make sure it groups them. The name is pretty explanatory again.</p>
<p> Third party is much cheaper then self hosting mostly due to the bandwidth when self hosting.
This assignment took some thinking out of the box. I had to play around with buttons here and there to figure it all out. The coolest part about this assignment was the way we learned how to embed videos and audio files even from subscription websites such as spotify. I also learned what an imbed link is and how easy it is to link a video or audio file to a website.
