  <h1>Bridges Burn</h1>
  <h2>NEEDTOBREATHE</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo<br />
Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo<br />
Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo<br />
Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo</p>

<p>It's time for moving on<br />
There's some things you can't forget<br />
It's sinking us like a stone<br />
I just wanna bury it</p>

<p>I wanna watch all my bridges burn<br />
Stand in the rain 'til the page is turned<br />
Dance in the light of a lesson learned, lesson learned<br />
I wanna leave everything that hurts<br />
Never go back to the way we were<br />
Set it on fire, baby, watch it burn, watch it burn</p>

<p>Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo<br />
Da-doo, da-doo, doo doo doo, doo doo</p>

<p>Out into the unknown<br />
We traded in our regrets<br />
Not gonna go alone<br />
'Cause we're gonna finish this</p>

<p>I wanna watch all my bridges burn<br />
Stand in the rain 'til the page is turned<br />
Dance in the light of a lesson learned, lesson learned<br />
I wanna leave everything that hurts<br />
Never go back to the way we were<br />
Set it on fire, baby, watch it burn, watch it burn</p>
