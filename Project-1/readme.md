<h1>project 1 technical report</h1>
The browser that I use most often is google chrome, but there are many such as safari, internet explorer, firefox and obviously others. The web browser sends a request over the network for the information tot he server. The information gets sent back and the browser interprets the information and you get the information presented to us that way.
I visited the cbs news website from august, 2000. The site looks absolutlely terrible compared to what they have today as their website. It is very interesting because Bill and Hillary Clinton are on the cover of the page and that was 18 years ago. They are still making headlines today. The website is difficult to look at because the colors don't fit well with each other which makes it difficult to view. The color is the biggest thing that has changed. Back then their main color was a dark navy blue with a yellow background while today their headline is black with the writing being over a white background.

This project actually was not too difficult compared to some of the assignments. The coolest part was seeing my first website be put up even if there isn't a tremendous amount of color involved with it.
