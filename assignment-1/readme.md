I think there can be an unlimited amount of head and body elements on a page.

Structural markup embeds the structure of a document while semantic is used to place emphasis on one specific item as opposed to the whole structure.

This assignment took me the longest of the assignments because I had to use so many different coding options that I never had to use before. This really tested my ability to follow instructions as well as figure it out on my own a little bit.
