<h1> Assignment 6 technical report</h1>

<p> I chose the graphic from the file of the 1980's that was a 3D rectangle and had all sorts of colors on there. I styled it with bright neon colors that are very telling of what the 80s was like in terms of color. </p>

<p> I used quite a few colors throughout the assignment mainly because thats what the 80s was about. Colors didn't necessarily match with each other but that was kind of the beauty behind it. I used a turquoise color for some of the writing, #37ff45 as one of the colors which is a sort of green, and #f1f1f1 as well.

This assignment was the most confusing to this point. I would add something correctly and I didn't feel like it would change anything at all. So it took a lot of adding and deleting especially on the style page.
