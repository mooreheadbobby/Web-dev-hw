    <p> Cereal has brought more joy to my life then anything else and I just want to share that love with you all.
      It doesn't matter the time of day, cereal can be consumed any time. It must be poured properly to get the most out of it.</p>

            <br>
            <li><b>1 gallon</b> of milk (after learning how to properly pour a bowl, you'll go through a whole gallon fast)</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>1 pinch</b> of sugar</li>
